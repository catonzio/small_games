# Small Games

This repository contains small games that I have created using Flutter, showcasing classical AI algorithms in action.

## Games Done

1. **Eight Puzzle**: A simple game of Eight Puzzle, where the AI uses the A* algorithm to solve the puzzle.
2. **Tic Tac Toe**: A simple game of Tic Tac Toe, where the AI uses the Minimax algorithm to play against the user.

## Games To Be Done

1. **Connect Four**: A simple game of Connect Four, where the AI uses the Minimax algorithm to play against the user.
2. **Minesweeper**: A simple game of Minesweeper, where the AI uses the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) algorithm to play the game.
3. **Sudoku**: A simple game of Sudoku, where the AI uses the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) algorithm to solve the puzzle.
4. **2048**: A simple game of 2048, where the AI uses the Expectimax algorithm to play the game.
5. **Snake**: A simple game of Snake, where the AI uses the A* algorithm to play the game.
6. **Pong**: A simple game of Pong, where the AI uses the Minimax algorithm to play against the user.
7. **Flappy Bird**: A simple game of Flappy Bird, where the AI uses the Genetic Algorithm to play the game.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Android Studio or Visual Studio Code.
3. Run the project on an emulator or a physical device.
